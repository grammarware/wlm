| name = Mcmurdo Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land
| description = The region incorporated by this ASMA is characterised as the largest relatively ice-free area in Antarctica, with approximately thirty percent of the ground surface largely free from snow and ice. It is an area of important scientific and wilderness values, with accumulated ice containing important records of past climate change, whilst the current climate serves as an important analogue for the conditions of ancient Earth and contemporary Mars. The Area contains unusual microhabitats and biological communities as well as special geological features and minerals. The Dry Valleys represent a nearly pristine environment largely undisturbed and uncontaminated by humans. The dramatic landscape, composed of high ridges and sweeping valleys and contrasts of ice-free and glacier-covered terrain, creates unique vistas with high aesthetic value. Activities conducted in the area include a variety of scientific research, operations in support of science, media, arts and education. The site's visitors include official national programme visitors as well as tourists. A Long Term Ecological Research site has also been established in the Taylor Valley.

| name = Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, East Antarctica
| description = Cape Denison is located in the centre of Commonwealth Bay, a 60 km-wide stretch of coast in George V Land. The Area is one of the principal sites of early human activity in Antarctica, and has considerable historical, cultural and scientific significance. It is the location of the base of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911-14 organised and led by Dr (later Sir) Douglas Mawson. An important symbol of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, it is one of only six hut sites remaining from this period. Cape Denison hosted some of the earliest comprehensive studies of Antarctic geology, geography, terrestrial magnetism, astronomy, meteorology, glaciology, oceanography, biology, zoology and botany. It was also the base of numerous explorations inland and features artefacts associated with these sledging parties, including food caches and equipment. Cape Denison is not only the windiest place in Antarctica, but also the windiest place on Earth at sea level. The site thus provides the physical and symbolic context of the extreme isolation and harsh conditions endured by the expedition members and, by association, all other heroic age researchers and explorers.

| name = Deception Island
| description = Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, has one of only two volcanoes in the Antarctic at which eruptions have been observed. Deception Island is a unique Antarctic island with important natural, scientific, historic, educational, aesthetic and wilderness values. It contains a restless caldera that is actively deforming and it is therefore likely that Deception Island will witness further eruptions in the future. The Area has an exceptionally important flora, including at least 18 species which have not been recorded elsewhere in the Antarctic. Of particular importance are the very small, unique biological communities associated with the island’s geothermal area. The island also has eight species of breeding seabirds including the world's largest colony of chinstrap penguins. The benthic habitat of Port Foster is of ecological interest due to the natural perturbations caused by volcanic activity.

The area is located in a region of high scientific value due to many factors including its exceptionally clean air, isolation from sound, vibration, and electro-magnetic interference (EMI), geophysically stable location, unique ice conditions and the isolated population of Station inhabitants. The Area also has significant historical value, containing the Ceremonial Pole and Amundsen’s Tent. Activities conducted in the area include diverse scientific research endeavours with extensive international collaboration, operations in support of science, medicine, media, arts, education and tourism.

| name = Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica
| description = The Area is an ice-free area of 40 km² which comprises also the near-shore islands, collectively known as the Larsemann Hills, and the adjacent plateau. The ice-free area consists of two major peninsulas (Stornes and Broknes), four minor peninsulas, and approximately 130 near shore islands. Substantial station-based research is undertaken on the site and tourists have visited the area on day trips. An increase in tourism Antarctica-wide has the potential over time to promote continued tourist visits to the Larsemann Hills, and the proposed establishment of a compacted snow airstrip near the site of the previous skiway may facilitate increased numbers of visits and visits of greater duration, including the potential for land-based (overnight) tourism. The initial period of intensive human activity between 1986 and 1989 and the subsequent conduct of science and support operations in the area have resulted in notable localised alteration of the environment, concentrated on eastern Broknes. The construction of station buildings, associated facilities and access routes on eastern Broknes has caused physical degradation of the ice-free surface. There is evidence of breakdown of rocks and exposure of the permafrost layer through repeated vehicle use which has caused surface erosion and altered drainage patterns. Chemical contamination of some lakes and soils has occurred through the accidental spillage of hydrocarbons and the disposal of wastewater on the ground surface. Several introduced floral species have also been detected.

| name = Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin
| description = The region includes south-west Anvers Island and the Palmer Basin and its fringing island groups. This is an area of considerable and increasing scientific, tourist and logistic activities. In particular, scientific research being undertaken within the Area is important for considering ecosystem interactions and long-term environmental changes in the region, and how these relate to Antarctica and the global environment more generally. This research is important to the work of the Committee for Environmental Protection, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the Antarctic Treaty System as a whole. There is a risk that these globally important research programs and long-term datasets could be compromised if activities were to occur in the marine area that were not appropriately managed to avoid potential conflicts and possible interference.

Pearson, who offered it to Chile. It was unveiled in 1999, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the signature of the Antarctic Treaty.

The ASPA comprises all of Sabrina Island above sea level, including the Monolith, and Chinstrap Islet. The area has outstanding environmental and scientific value. It is a representative sample of the Balleny Islands which is the only oceanic archipelago located within the main Antarctic Coastal Current. As such, they provide important resting and breeding habitat for seabird and seal species, and are significant in circumpolar distributions of a variety of species. Being isolated and prone to difficult weather and ice conditions, the Islands have had very little human disturbance.

| name = Cape Hallett, Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea
| description = Cape Hallett is located at the southern end of Moubray Bay, Northern Victoria Land, in the western Ross Sea. The Area contains a variety of habitats with plant communities that are the most extensive and representative examples known at the northern end of the latitudinal gradient of Victoria Land and the Ross Sea. South Polar skuas and a large Adélie penguin colony also nest on the site.  The history of human impact on the colony make this site unique and ideal for scientific study of impacts on, and recovery of, the colony following substantial ecosystem disturbance. The Area also possesses outstanding aesthetic values with its combination of prolific biological resources. The history of human activity at the former station is also of interest to visitors.

| name = Emperor Island, Dion Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula
| description = The Dion Islands, a small archipelago comprising several islands, rocks and reefs, are situated 13.5km south of the south-western extremity of Adelaide Island in Marguerite Bay. The site contains the only colony of emperor penguins known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the isolation of this colony from others of the same species makes it of outstanding scientific interest. It is also the most northerly and probably the smallest emperor penguin colony, and one of only two in which breeding occurs on land. Adélie penguins and blue-eyed shags also breed here.

| name = Green Island, Berthelot Islands, Antarctic Peninsula
| description = Green Island is a small island situated 150m north of the largest of the Berthelot Islands group in Grandidier Channel, approximately 3 km off the Graham Coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The vegetation on the area is exceptionally rich, with well-developed continuous banks of moss turf and small patches of Antarctic hair grass. While the vegetation on Green Island is not as regionally diverse as once thought, in recent years it has largely escaped significant damage to its moss banks that more northerly islands have been subjected to by Antarctic fur seals. A large blue-eyed shag colony, brown skuas, south polar skuas and hybrids are also found. The colony of blue-eyed cormorants is possibly one of the largest along the Antarctic Peninsula.

| description = Moe Island, South Orkney Islands, is a small irregularly shaped island lying 300m off the south-western extremity of Signy Island, from which it is separated by Fyr Channel. It provides a representative example of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem, including large banks of moss turf and colonies of Chinstrap penguins, Cape petrels and Antarctic prions. Weddell seals and fur seals also haul out on the island's beaches. Moe Island is protected as a control area for future comparison with neighbouring Signy Island, which has been subjected to intensive scientific research and major changes in its low altitude terrestrial system due to disruption from fur seals. Additionally, Moe Island contains the greatest continuous expanses of Chorisodontium-Polytrichum moss turf found in Antarctica.

| name = Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands
| description = Lynch Island is a small island situated at the eastern end of Marshall Bay in the South Orkney Islands, about 200m south of Coronation Island and 2.4km north of Signy Island. The Area includes the whole island above the low tide water level, excluding offshore islets and rocks. The island supports one of the most extensive and dense stands of Antarctic hair grass known in the Antarctic Treaty Area; an outstanding example of a rare natural ecological system. Several species of moss are unusually fertile, and the soil contains a rich invertebrate fauna. Most species of Antarctic seals are common around the island. Despite localised damage from Antarctic fur seals, limited human disturbance via visitation, scientific research and sampling, means the Area has potential value as a reference site to measure against comparable ecosystems which are experiencing substantial changes as a result of fur seal activities.
